# HP Vector Driver with IPA Fonts

This repository redistributes HP Vector Driver which used to be distributed under the Open Printing Framework Consortium (OPFC) project: https://sourceforge.jp/projects/opfc/.
Since the original version was distributed under GNU GPLv2, this redistributed version is also under GPLv2.
See [LICENSE](LICENSE) (which was added by the redistributor as the license document of GPLv2 in the original version was an older version).

Contents in the `opfc-ModuleHP-1.1.1_withIPAFonts` directory are verbatim copies of the original version (i.e. just extracted from the compressed archive).
You can download the original compressed archive file from the release page.
